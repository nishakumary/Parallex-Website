    <!--<h1>Hey! It's Dog Dictionary</h1>
    <p>Humans share a compassionate bond with pets in general. Studies already demonstrate that dog owners have lower suicide cases and better mental health. Through my app, I wanted to convey the same feeling of compassion and warmth. Hence, I chose warm primary colors.

        Also, my app is intended to assist diverse age groups so I went for an easily readable and playful font for heading and main texts while a geometric and modern font for other content.
        
        For the next part, I established a hierarchy in type and buttons to bring about consistency over the app. This helped in creating a uniform design language to work on.</p>
